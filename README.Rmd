This is a complete rewrite of [`{plumber}`](https://www.rplumber.io) R package. The
purpose of the rewrite is to take everything we’ve learned from `{plumber}`,
shed the bad decisions that you inevitably make over the course of
development, and start from scratch.

You’ll find that `{plumber2}` is very similar to `{plumber}` in a lot of ways
but diverts in key areas, resulting in API incompatibility between the
two packages. Because of this, you may need to update your existing `{plumber}`
decorators when switching to `{plumber2}`.

## Installation

`{plumber2}` is still a work in progress, and it is recommended to only use it to
experiment and get familiarity with the future direction of plumber APIs. If you
wish to try it out you can install the development version from GitHub using
[pak](https://pak.r-lib.org):

```r
pak::pak("posit-dev/plumber2")
```

## Feedback

At this point in the development, feedback is crucial! If you do decide to try
out `{plumber2}`, please share your experience (both good and bad), and ask questions
as it informs us about where to spend more time with documentation.

## Hello World

Below is a simple "hello world" API written for `{plumber2}` that illustrates some
of the differences from `{plumber}`:

```r
#* Echo the parameter that was sent in
#*
#* @get /echo/<msg>
#*
#* @param msg:string The message to echo back.
#*
#* @response 200:{msg:string} A string containing the input message
#*
function(msg) {
  list(
    msg = paste0("The message is: '", msg, "'")
  )
}

#* Plot out data from the palmer penguins dataset
#*
#* @get /plot
#*
#* @query spec:enum|Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo| If provided, filter the
#* data to only this species
#*
#* @serializer png{width = 700, height = 500}
#* @serializer jpeg{width = 700, height = 500}
#*
#* @async
function(query) {
  myData <- palmerpenguins::penguins
  title <- "All Species"

  # Filter if the species was specified
  if (!is.null(query$spec)){
    title <- paste0("Only the '", query$spec, "' Species")
    myData <- subset(myData, species == query$spec)
    if (nrow(myData) == 0) {
      abort_internal_error("Missing data for {query$spec}")
    }
  }

  plot(
    myData$flipper_length_mm,
    myData$bill_length_mm,
    main=title,
    xlab="Flipper Length (mm)",
    ylab="Bill Length (mm)"
  )
}
```

Above you can both see some breaking changes and some new features in action.
The biggest breaking change is that parameters coming from the **path**, the **query**
string, and the **body** are now clearly separated. Only parameters from the path
are provided as direct arguments to the handler function. Query and body
parameters are accessible through the `query` and `body` argument respectively.

The parsing of plumber blocks have been greatly improved.
It is now built upon `{roxygen2}`, automatically allowing for
multiline tags and defaulting to the first line as title and proceeding untagged
lines as description. The ability to define input and output types has also been
greatly expanded, adding the ability to define nested objects, adding default
values and (as seen above) define enum (factors) to name a few. All inputs will
get type checked and their default value imputed when not requested.

For the `/plot` handler you can also see that it specifies multiple serializers.
Doing so will allow the client to request its preferred response format using
the `Accept` header. `{plumber2}` will then perform content negotiation to figure
out the best response format based on what it supports and what the client
prefers.

Lastly, you can see a new tag (one of many) in the `/plot` handler. `@async`
allows you to convert your handler into an async handler automatically. It is
still possible to create an async handler manually by returning a promise, but
the new tag significantly simplifies this for the most classic cases. There is
still overhead involved in handling requests asynchronously so this is mainly a
good idea for non-trivial handlers, but it is shown here as an example.
