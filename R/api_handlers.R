#' Add a handler for a request
#'
#' This family of functions facilitates adding a request handler for a specific
#' HTTP method and path.
#'
#' # HTTP Methods
#' The HTTP specs provide a selection of specific methods that clients can send
#' to the server (your plumber api). While there is no enforcement that the
#' server follows any conventions you should strive to create a server API that
#' adheres to common expectations. It is not required that a server understands
#' all methods, most often the opposite is true. The HTTP methods are described
#' below, but consider consulting [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods)
#' to get acquainted with the HTTP spec in general
#'
#' * `GET`: This method is used to request specific content and is perhaps the
#'   most ubiquitous method in use. `GET` requests should only retrieve data and
#'   should not contain any body content
#' * `HEAD`: This method is identical to `GET`, except the response should only
#'   contain headers, no body. Apart from this it is expected that a `HEAD`
#'   request is identical to a `GET` request for the same ressource
#' * `POST`: This method delivers content, in the form of a request body, to the
#'   server, potentially causing a change in the server. In the context of
#'   plumber2 it is often used to call functions that require input larger than
#'   what can be put in the URL
#' * `PUT`: This method is used to update a specific ressource on the server. In
#'   the context of a standard plumber2 server this is rarely relevant, though
#'   usage can come up. `PUT` is considered by clients to be indemptotent meaning
#'   that sending the same `PUT` request multiple times have no effect
#' * `DELETE`: This method deletes a ressource and is the opposite to `PUT`. As
#'   with `PUT` this method has limited use in most standard plumber2 servers
#' * `CONNECT`: This method request the establishment of a proxy tunnel. It is
#'   considered advanced use and is very unlikely to have a usecase for your
#'   plumber2 api
#' * `OPTIONS`: This method is used by clients to query a server about what
#'   methods and other settings are supported on a server
#' * `TRACE`: This method is a form of ping that should send a response
#'   containing the request (stripped of any sensitive information). Many
#'   servers disallow this method due to security concerns
#' * `PATCH`: This method is like `PUT` but allows partial modification of a
#'   ressource
#'
#' Apart from the above, plumber2 also understands the `ANY` method which
#' responds to requests to any of the above methods, assuming that a specific
#' handler for the method is not found. As the semantics of the various methods
#' are quite different an `ANY` handler should mainly be used for rejections or
#' for setting specific broad headers on the response, not as the main handler
#' for the request
#'
#' # The Path
#' The path defines the URL the request is being made to with the root removed.
#' If your plumber2 server runs from `http://example.com/api/` and a request is
#' made to `http://example.com/api/user/thomas/`, then the path would be
#' `user/thomas/`. Paths can be static like the prior example, or dynamic as
#' described below:
#'
#' ## Path arguments
#' Consider you have a bunch of users. It would be impractical to register a
#' handler for each one of them. Instead you can use a dynamic path like with
#' the following syntax: `user/<username>/`. This path would be matched to any
#' requests made to `user/..something../`. The actual value of `..something..`
#' (e.g. `thomas`) would be made available to the handler (see below). A path
#' can contain multiple arguments if needed, such as
#' `user/<username>/settings/<setting>/`
#'
#' ## Path wildcards
#' Apart from path arguments it is also possible to be even less specific by
#' adding a wildcard to the path. The path `user/*` will match both
#' `user/thomas/`, `user/thomas/settings/interests/`, and anything other path
#' that begins with `user/`. As with arguments a path can contain multiple
#' wildcards but the use of these have very diminishing returns. Contrary to
#' path arguments the value(s) corresponding to `*` is not made available to the
#' handler.
#'
#' ## Path Priority
#' With the existence of path arguments and wildcards it is possible that
#' multiple handlers in a route can be matched to a single request. Since only
#' one can be selected we need to determine which one wins. The priority is
#' based on the specificity of the path. Consider a server containing the
#' following handler paths: `user/thomas/`, `user/<username>/`,
#' `user/<username>/settings/<setting>/`, `user/*`. These paths will have the
#' following priority:
#'
#' 1. `user/<username>/settings/<setting>/`
#' 2. `user/thomas/`
#' 3. `user/<username>/`
#' 4. `user/*`
#'
#' The first spot is due to the fact that it is the path with the most elements
#' so it is deemed most specific. For the remaining 3 they all have the same
#' number of elements, but static paths are considered more specific than
#' dynamic paths, and path arguments are considered more specific than
#' wildcards.
#'
#' A request made to `user/carl` will thus end up in the third handler, while a
#' request made to `user/thomas` will end up in the second. This ordering makes
#' it possible to both provide default handlers as well as specialisations for
#' specific paths.
#'
#' # The Handler
#' The handler is a standard R function that is called when a request is made
#' that matches the handlers path (unless a more specific handler path exists â€”
#' see above). A handler function can perform any operation a normal R function
#' can do, though you should consider strongly the security implications of your
#' handler functions. However, there are certain expectations in plumber around
#' the arguments a handler function takes and the return value it provides
#'
#' ## Handler Arguments
#' The handler function can take one or more of the following arguments.
#' * **Path arguments**: Any path arguments are passed on to the handler. If a
#'   handler is registered for the following path
#'   `user/<username>/settings/<setting>/` and it handles a request to
#'   `user/thomas/settings/interests/` then it will be called with
#'   `username = "thomas", setting = "interest"`
#' * `request`: The request the handler is responding to as a [reqres::Request]
#'   object
#' * `response`: The response being returned to the client as a
#'   [reqres::Response] object
#' * `server`: The [Plumber2] object representing your server implementation
#' * `client_id`: A string uniquely identifying the session the request comes
#'   from
#' * `query`: A list giving any additional arguments passed into the handler as
#'   part of the url query string
#' * `body`: The request body, parsed as specified by the provided parsers
#'
#' ## Handler Return Value
#' Handlers can return a range of different value types, which will inform
#' plumber2 what to do next:
#'
#' ### Returning `Next` or `Break`
#' These two control objects informs plumber2 to either proceed handling the
#' request (`Next`) or return the response as is, circumventing any remaining
#' routes (`Break`)
#'
#' ### Returning `NULL` or the `response` object
#' This is the same as returning `Next`, ie. it signals that handling can
#' proceed
#'
#' ### Returning a ggplot2 object
#' If you return a \pkg{ggplot2} object it will get plotted for you (and added to the
#' response assuming a graphics serializer is provided) before handling
#' continues
#'
#' ### Returning any other value
#' Any kind of value returned that is not captured by the above description will
#' be set to the response body (overwritting what was already there) and
#' handling is then allowed to continue
#'
#' ## Handler conditions
#' Like any function in R, a handler may need to signal that something happened,
#' either by throwing an error or warning or by emitting a message. You can use
#' [stop()], [warning()], and [message()] as you are used to. For all of them,
#' the condition message will end up in the log. Further, for `stop()` any
#' further handling of the request will end and a `500 Internal Error` response
#' is returned. To take more control over problems you can use the
#' [`abort_*()`][abort_status] family of conditions from reqres. Like `stop()`
#' they will halt any further processing, but they also allow control over what
#' kind of response is sent back, what kind of information about the issue is
#' communicated to the client, and what kind of information is logged
#' internally. The response they send back (except for `abort_status()`) all
#' adhere to the HTTP Problem spec defined in
#' [RFC 9457](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9457).
#'
#' While it may feel like a good idea to send a detailed error message back to
#' the client it is often better to only inform the client of what they need to
#' change to solve the issue. Too much information about internal implementation
#' details can be a security risk and forwarding internal errors to a client can
#' help inform the client about how the server has been implemented.
#'
#' @param api A plumber2 api object to add the handler to
#' @param path A string giving the path the handler responds to. See Details
#' @param handler A handler function to call when a request is matched to the
#' path
#' @param serializers A named list of serializers that can be used to format the
#' response before sending it back to the client. Which one is selected is based
#' on the request `Accept` header. See [get_serializers()] for a helper to
#' construct this
#' @param parsers A named list of parsers that can be used to parse the
#' request body before passing it in as the `body` argument. Which one is
#' selected is based on the request `Content-Type` header. See [get_parsers()]
#' for a helper to construct this
#' @param use_strict_serializer By default, if a serializer that respects the
#' requests `Accept` header cannot be found, then the first of the provided ones
#' are used. Setting this to `TRUE` will instead send back a
#' `406 Not Acceptable` response
#' @param download Should the response mark itself for download instead of being
#' shown inline? Setting this to `TRUE` will set the `Content-Disposition`
#' header in the response to `attachment`. Setting it to a string is equivalent
#' to setting it to `TRUE` but will in addition also set the default filename of

#' Add a new route to either the request or header router
#'
#' This function allows explicit creation of routes or addition/merging of a

#' created with the `route` argument when [adding a handler][api_get]. However,

#' Add a handler to a WebSocket message
#'
#' WebSockets is a bidirectional communication channel that can be established
#' at the request of the client. While websocket communication is not really
#' part of a standard REST api, it has many uses and can easily be used together
#' with one.
#'
#' A handler for a websocket message is much simpler than for requests in
#' general since it doesn't have to concern itself with methods, paths, and
#' responses. Any message handler registered will get called in sequence when a
#' websocket message is recieved from a client. Still, a few expectations apply
#'
#' ## Handler Arguments
#' The handler can take any of the following arguments:
#' * `message`: Either a raw vector if the message recieved is in binary form or
#'   a single string, giving the message sent from the client
#' * `server`: The [Plumber2] object representing your server implementation
#' * `client_id`: A string uniquely identifying the session the request comes
#'   from
#' * `request`: The request that was initially used to establish the websocket
#'   connection with the client as a [reqres::Request] object
#'
#' ## Handler Return Value
#' It is not expected that a websocket message sends a response and thus the
#' handler is not required to do anything like that. However, if the handler
#' returns either a raw vector or a single string it is taken as a signal to
#' send this back to the client. Any other return value is silently ignored.

#' @param api A plumber2 api object to add the handler to
#' @param handler A function conforming to the specifications laid out in
#' Details

}

#' Redirect request to another resource
#'
#' While it is optimal that an API remains stable over its lifetime it is often
#' not fully attainable. In order to direct requests for ressources that has
#' been moved to the new location you can add a redirect that ensures a smooth
#' transition for clients still using the old path. Depending on the value
#' of `permanent` the redirect will respond with a `307 Temporary Redirect` or
#' `308 Permanent Redirect`. `from` and `to` can contain path parameters and
#' wildcards which will be matched between the two to construct the correct
#' redirect path. Further, `to` can either be a path to the same server or a
#' fully qualified URL to redirect requests to another server alltogether.
#'
#' @param api A plumber2 api object to add the redirect to
#' @param method The HTTP method the redirect should respond to
#' @param from The path the redirect should respond to
#' @param to The path/URL to redirect the incoming request towards. After
#' resolving any path parameters and wildcards it will be used in the
#' `Location` header
#' @param permanent Logical. Is the redirect considered permanent or
#' temporary? Determines the type of redirct status code to use
